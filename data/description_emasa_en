the company the municipal company aguas de malaga s a emasa was created by he city council in from the structure of the municipal water supply services from our origin we have gone from being only a water supplier to consolidating ourselves as a company for the integral management of the water cycle throughout our history we have grown from to clients to employees emasa currently manages three wastewater treatment stations guadalhorce peñón del cuervo and olías three drinking water treatment stations el atabal pilones and el limonero and forty five wastewater pumping stations ebar emasa's corporate purpose is the management and administration of the integral water cycle in the city of malaga and its municipal area destined for domestic industrial or urban uses of any kind; from the capture of the necessary water resources their distribution purification desalination and supply to the elimination and discharge of used water or where appropriate the reuse of the already purified water emasa also aims to promote scientific research and cultural activities that collaborate in the study and preservation of the environment the network directorate it controls maintains and operates the drinking water distribution network at the municipal level distribution supply connections and meters maintenance and inspection it also controls maintains and exploits the wastewater network to the pumping stations in the municipal area distribution network the pipes of the network began to be built in it is formed by a meshed system made up of four main networks in high and low elevation divided into two aspects east and west it has an approximate extension of km the diameter of the pipes ranges from to mm sanitation network the first collectors date from the th century it is formed by a branched network of more than km more than rainwater absorbers implementation of a mobility warning management system the networks department is responsible for the maintenance of the supply and sanitation networks of the municipality of malaga within these maintenance works an important part is taken care of incidents that clients and users communicate to us through different means callcenter mainly web page writing etc these incidents are channeled through the different operators taking the different data necessary to resolve the fault and transferring them to the entity notice of our computerized maintenance system for network work the most relevant data are the address of the incident telephone number description of the incident observations etc this incident care service is permanently attended once all the incident data has been collected in the notice it is now available in the notification tray of the network supervisor who is responsible for that specific shift in the event that the incident or fault reported is an important and emerging problem the reception staff contact the person in charge directly to expedite the resolution of that incident the maintenance service always has at least one supervisor responsible for the resolution of these incidents hours a day days a year currently practically all of the supply related incidents are managed by our own personnel with the participation of foremen and brigades made up of an officer and an assistant who are on duty so that we are able to cover the all hours of the year as a general rule they are distributed into brigades in the morning on a working day in the afternoon on those same days brigades in each of the shifts morning and afternoon on holidays and brigade on the night shift of all days on the other hand incidents related to sanitation networks and their auxiliary elements registers covers absorbers etc are handled by contracts for this work the participation of three contracts that are governed by framework contracts in which a certain price table is agreed for the performance of different complete works including materials labor auxiliary elements security signage etc although the work is carried out by means outside of emasa its control and supervision always rests with the supervisors to carry out the work according to the established quality criteria in addition to this it is important to highlight the attention that is made to incidents related to bottlenecks in the sanitation network that are transferred in the same way as the rest and are resolved through two contracts an information system made up of a subsystem for use in the office call center network administrators network managers a subsystem destined to be used in mobility on a smartphone tablet which will allow managing the fundamental aspects of the operation of the operational brigades and emasa technicians the management of the notices from their generation to their resolution is carried out according to the following tasks generation of the notice input information originator user interlocutor contact information telephone name policy location of the notice postal address and or gps positioning indicated on gis notice type based on a system of predefined types atoro water comes out of the manhole broken manhole descriptive data of the notice according to the type drinking or waste water estimated flow danger urgency of the problem attached documents pdf photos and videos previous treatment of the notice when the notice is generated in the call center it decides if it corresponds to a notice of urgent or planned attention through a configurable status the notice is automatically assigned to a supervisor depending on the type of notice the status of the notice can be changed by the supervisor going from urgent to planned care or vice versa or be transferred to another supervisor notice management the supervisor reviews the notice and takes the necessary actions to obtain all the information it considers to evaluate the actions and updates the information in the notice when opening the notice for its management the information that its management has started is automatically generated so that it can be sent to the originator by email the supervisor can know the cause beforehand in which case he chooses a diagnosis cause from a series of possible diagnoses for each type of notice sunken chest broken valve if the information is sufficient the supervisor can reply to the originator and update the information in the notice without visiting it if the information is not sufficient or the supervisor deems it necessary you can assign a visit to the location of the notice of a mobile operator in both cases the notice is answered with the result chosen from a predefined series either on desktop or on the move notice close a notice can generate a work order of any type even if it is not linked to the type of the notice this ot is anchored to the notice allowing traceability between both as well as the subordinate ots the notice closes when it is answered and an ot is not generated the ot that has been generated by the notice is closed the closing of the notice being automatic if the originator has left an email the system must automatically answer the closing of the notice and the actions carried out general requirements prior to the generation of the notice a decision making template may be completed based on a checklist that identifies whether or not to generate a notice the system will have a treatment of duplicate notices so that when generating a notice it is previously checked if another recent notice has been generated in the geographical environment consulting the s i g the notices will carry a classification of the type of notice to clearly identify the incident and to be able to properly manage it this initial cataloging of the notice must be maintained during its management although it may change the type of notice after the checks that can be made during the generation of the notice if the policy or the equipment it affects is identified the existing data in sap must be filled in automatically such as the address of the team that corresponds to that of the notice customer data the notices that are related to each other at the discretion of the operator must be unified in their treatment and traceability including the request of the generator the result of the actual inspection of what has happened if applicable and the resulting action likewise successive notices in time that have the same origin must be related being able to identify them and consult the actions carried out searches may be by any attribute of the notice such as geographical proximity the notices must have the complete traceability of the state in which it is queued open dispatched to mobility printed generated ot closed this traceability can be reviewed by the supervisor and the call center easily filtering for that state mobility application requirements the following functions can be performed from the mobile ad management application you will be able to view existing notices and create new notices you can modify the initial data of the notice those taken by the customer service office you can add gis elements to the notice for this the mobile device must have the gis information of the area preloaded the ui for adding gis elements should be simple and intuitive you may reassign the notice to another supervisor foreman or contract you can change the diagnosis of the warning it will be able to generate ots from among some predetermined types unclog box change valve and with a detail field you can complete the notice you will be able to take photos and assign them to the notice you can take your gps position and assign it to the warning the mobility device must be able to work offline information should never be lost due to a disconnection that is even if you are not connected you should be able to open the notifications that had come to you and inform them although the modification will not be sent until you are connected again emasa is a company dedicated to the
